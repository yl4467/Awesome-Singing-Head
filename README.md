# Awesome-Singing-Head
The aim of this project is to make it easier for the research of singing head/face. This repo mainly focus on the audio-driven singing head generation task. If you are researching in singing head generation task, can send email to: liyan22021121@gmail.com for better communication and cooperations.

## Data Preprocess Tools

### Audio Preprocess Tools
1. Use spleeter to [Spleeter](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter) extract the human voice as lyric information and the background music as melody information.

### Video Preprocess Tools
1. Align each video to the corresponding music audio: [SyncNet](https://github.com/joonson/syncnet_python)
2. Video cropping and serialization: detect the bounding box of the facial region using MTCNN and Dlib to detect the 68 landmarks
